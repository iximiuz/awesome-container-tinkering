# Awesome Container Tinkering

An ever-growing list of tools to tinker with containers.

## Project

Not an [awesome-docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker) list. Instead of being a beginner-focused all-encompassing list of resources to get into containers, this project will be collecting links to (and thoughts about):

- Lower-level building blocks (runtimes, libraries, CLIs)
- Solutions for running containers locally and remotely
- Helper tools and libraries to inspect, edit, or move images
- In-depth write-ups and video resources on the above topics.

The project is WIP. The current list of categories includes:

- [Container runtimes](./RUNTIMES.md)
- [Image builders, viewers, editors](./IMAGES.md)
- [Development environments](./ENVIRONMENTS.md)
- [Container networking tools](./NETWORKING.md)
- [Image distribution and artifact management](./DISTRIBUTIONS.md)
- [Interesting GitHub organizations](./ORGANIZATIONS.md)
- [Container Standards and Specifications](./SPECIFICATIONS.md)

## Audience

Everyone should be able to find something useful here, but to get the most out of it you'd probably need some prior familiarity with Docker (or the like). Potential target audience:

- Infrastructure folks (DevOps, SREs, System Administrators)
- Developers of Cloud Native tools
- Or just anyone willing to seriously strengthen their container game.

## Motivation

Over the years, I've accumulated tens of links to various container-related projects, so, first of all, I just needed a place for a brain dump. But also to share, to get feedback, and to learn more about the tools from the community. Sharing is caring!
