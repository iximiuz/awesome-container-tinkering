### LXC

<a href="https://github.com/lxc/lxc">LXC</a> - "Linux Containers." An alternative (i.e., non-OCI) implementation of containers using Linux OS-level virtualization primitives (namespaces, cgroups, etc). Daemonless, can work as a library or as a CLI tool. Back in 2013, Docker started as a UX layer on top of LXC but eventually moved to its own implementation (known as **libcontainer** & **runc** today). The key design difference between Docker and LXC is that the former focuses on single-purpose containers (i.e., one container - one application), while the latter tries to be a seamless replacement for traditional (potentially multi-tenant) Linux servers (VM or bare metal, doesn't matter). Read this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/907613/">alternative story of containers on LWN.net for more</a>.

## High-level container runtimes

### Docker Engine _aka_ Moby

<a href="https://github.com/moby/moby">Moby</a> - "A collaborative project for the container ecosystem to assemble container-based systems." Docker lives somewhere here.

### Docker Compose

<a href="https://github.com/docker/compose">compose</a> - "Define and run multi-container applications with Docker."

### Podman

<a href="https://github.com/containers/podman">Podman</a> - "A tool for managing OCI containers and pods." Daemonless drop-in replacement for Docker (not quite).

### LXD

<a href="https://github.com/canonical/lxd">LXD</a> - "Powerful system container and virtual machine manager." Formerly a daughter project of LCX, it is now a Canonical project. Like the Docker daemon, LXD is a daemon that (in particular) provides HTTP API to manage containers powered by LXC. LXD comes with a CLI client called _lxc_ (not to be confused with LXC's own CLI clients, though).

### Incus

<a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus">Incus</a> - also a "Powerful system container and virtual machine manager." A community-led fork of Canonical's LXD (see above). Incus "is roughly equivalent to LXD but with a number of breaking changes on top of the obvious rename." While Incus promises to maintain backward compatibility (with itself) in its future versions, the early days of the fork are used as an opportunity to remove a lot of unused or problematic features of LXD.

### Focker

<a href="https://github.com/sadaszewski/focker">Focker</a> - "A FreeBSD image/jail orchestration tool in the vein of Docker."

A Docker-like tool written in Python and using FreeBSD jails instead of Linux namespaces & co.

### footloose

<a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose">footloose</a> - "Container Machines - Containers that look like Virtual Machines."

Regular containers but with systemd as PID 1 and an SSH daemon inside. Such "machines" behave very much like a VM, it's even possible to run dockerd in them.

### üë®‚Äçüî¨ Rootbox

<a href="https://github.com/joaompinto/rootbox">Rootbox</a> - "An extremely simple and fast container engine for Linux and WSL, written in Python."


## Container-runtime shims

A piece of software that sits in between a low-level container runtime and a higher-level container runtime.

### conmon

<a href="https://github.com/containers/conmon">conmon</a> - "An OCI container runtime monitor."

### conmon-rs

<a href="https://github.com/containers/conmon-rs">conmon-rs</a> - conmon, but in Rust.

## Introspection and debugging tools

### cdebug

<a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/cdebug">cdebug</a> - "a swiss army knife of container debugging."

The `cdebug exec` command is a crossbreeding of `docker exec` and `kubectl debug` commands. You point the tool at a running container, say what toolkit image to use, and it starts a debugging "sidecar" container that feels like a regular `docker exec` session (i.e., shares most of the target container's namespaces and has the same rootfs).

The `cdebug port-forward` command is another crossbreeding - this time it's `kubectl port-forward` and `ssh -L|-R`. With `cdebug port-forward -L` you can forward traffic destined to a host's port to an arbitrary container port even if it wasn't published or the target container is listening on localhost. With `cdebug port-forward -R` (coming soon) you can expose any endpoints accessible from your host back to the container' or Kubernetes network.

### debug-ctr

<a href="https://github.com/felipecruz91/debug-ctr">debug-ctr</a> - "Commandline tool for interactive container troubleshooting."

A debugger that creates a new container out of the original container with the toolkit mounted in a volume.

### docker-debug

<a href="https://github.com/zeromake/docker-debug">docker-debug</a> - "use new container attach on already container go on debug."

Start a new container with an image of choice (`nicolaka/netshoot` by default) that shares (some of) the target container's namesapces. Much like `cdebug exec` but with no `chroot` magic and supports only Docker as a container runtime.

### docker-opener

<a href="https://github.com/artemkaxboy/docker-opener">docker-opener</a> - "Shell-in to any docker container easily."

A multi-purpose tool that in particular can run a shell session into your container (and if there is no shell inside, it'll bring its own busybox).

### cntr

<a href="https://github.com/Mic92/cntr">cntr</a> - "A container debugging tool based on FUSE."

"A replacement for `docker exec` that brings all your developers tools with you" by mounting the file system from one container (or the host) into the target container and creating a nested container with the help of a FUSE filesystem. Supports a huge range of runtimes (docker, podman, LXC/LXD, rkt, systemd-nspawn, containerd) because it operates directly on the OS level.

### üë®‚Äçüî¨ kdiag

<a href="https://github.com/solo-io/kdiag">kdiag</a> - "Diagnostics and Debug Tooling" for Kubernetes workloads.

A kubectl plugin to get shell access to scratch containers, stream logs from multiple pods simultaneously, and do reverse port forwarding to Kubernetes clusters.

### containerdbg

<a href="https://github.com/google/containerdbg">containerdbg</a> - "Automate container debugging tasks."

An "all-in-one" (more like "several-in-one" at the moment) CLI to help debug Kubernetes workloads with common issues that arise when moving legacy applications to containers. Can detect missing files (by tracking open file requests via Cilium's eBPF library), fs race conditions (when `rename` and `move` are assumed atomic), and failed network connections and static IP usage (via miekg's DNS tracing library). Written in C.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è amicontained

<a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/amicontained">amicontained</a> - "Container introspection tool. Find out what container runtime is being used as well as features available."

### ig

<a href="https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/ig/">ig</a> - "Collection of eBPF gadgets for containers."

`ig` provides a set of eBPF gadgets that can be used to debug workloads running in containers. It supports multiple runtimes such as `Docker`, `containerd`, `CRI-O`, and `Podman`. The gadgets are classified into [different categories](https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/gadgets/) based on their use case, such as listing containers with the highest block IO or tracing DNS packets / exec system calls. 

## In-container init systems

### ‚≠ê tini

<a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini">tini</a> - "A tiny but valid `init` for containers."

Tini is meant to be run in a container - it spawns a single child and waits for it to exit all the while reaping zombies and performing signal forwarding. Written in C, and comes in both, dynamically and statically linked, forms.

### dumb-init

<a href="https://github.com/yelp/dumb-init">dumb-init</a> - "A minimal init system for Linux containers."

A simple process supervisor and init system designed to run as PID 1 inside minimal container environments. It is deployed as a small, statically-linked binary written in C.
