# Tools To Deal With Container Images

## Base images

### Distroless 1.0

<a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless">distroless</a> - "Language focused docker images, minus the operating system" _aka_ "scratch for everyone else." 

Read <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-distroless-images/">my overview of the distroless project on iximiuz.com</a>.

### Chainguard Images

<a href="https://github.com/chainguard-images">Chainguard Images</a> - "A collection of container (OCI) images designed for minimalism and security."

Many of them are distroless and contain only an application and its runtime dependencies. Typically, there is no shell or package manager. Image building procedure is designed to be reproducible and declarative (see **apko** and **melange** below).

## Image Building

### ‚≠ê BuildKit

<a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">BuildKit</a> - "concurrent, cache-efficient, and Dockerfile-agnostic builder toolkit."

A daemon that, in particular, powers the Docker image building. Uses its own intermediate language (LLB) to describe build tasks (but comes with a default frontend that compiles Dockerfiles to LLB). Can produce different forms of artifacts (Docker images, OCI images, tar archives, local files). Uses isolated builder backends (containers, remote servers, in-kubernetes builders, etc). Supports out-of-the-box cross-platform builds, different cache sources & destinations (inline, registry, local, etc). Check out this [good practical overview](https://blog.kubesimplify.com/the-secret-gems-behind-building-container-images-enter-buildkit-and-docker-buildx) for more.

### ‚≠ê Docker buildx plugin

<a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx">buildx</a> - "Docker CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit."

At first sight, the plugin is just another `docker build`-like command but on top of a better build engine (BuildKit). Often I'd just replace `docker build` with `docker buildx build` and call it a day. In actuality, though, `docker buildx` is the de facto standard CLI tool to access the full power of BuildKit. There is much more than just `docker buildx build` (see the list of BuildKit's capabilities above).

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ bake

<a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_bake.md">bake</a> - container-aware _make_.

This _buildx_ subcommand is worth mentioning separately:

> BuildKit efficiently handles multiple concurrent build requests and de-duplicates work. The build commands can be combined with general-purpose command runners (for example, `make`). However, these tools generally invoke builds in sequence and therefore cannot leverage the full potential of BuildKit parallelization, or combine BuildKit's output for the user. For this use case, we have added a command called `docker buildx bake`.

The `bake` command supports building images (<a href="https://iximiuz.ck.page/posts/container-tools-tips-and-tricks-issue-1">and not only</a>) from HCL or JSON files by describing _make_-like targets. And it also understands docker-compose YAML files.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è üë®‚Äçüî¨ kim

<a href="https://github.com/rancher/kim">kim</a> - "The Kubernetes Image Manager."

The tool consists of a builder backend (BuildKit daemon bound to the kubelet's underlying containerd socket) and a server-side agent (both deployed as one DaemonSet), and the _kim_ CLI (that talks to the agent) with a classic Docker-like UX for image management (push, pull, etc).

### ‚≠ê Packer

<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/packer">Packer</a> - "A tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration."

Packer is primarily focused on producing virtual machine images but it also allows building Docker, LXC, and LXD images using a similar to VM-provisioning procedure (read, by putting shell commands into a HCL file).

A collection of tools to support cross-compilation from Dockerfiles that understand the `--platform` flag passed in from `docker build` or `docker buildx build`. These helpers allow you to build multi-platform images from any architecture into any architecture supported by your compiler with native performance. Adding `xx` to your Dockerfile should only need minimal updates and should not require custom conditions for specific architectures. Example: `apk add` becomes `xx-apk add`, `apt-get install` becomes `xx-apt-get install`, `go build` becomes `xx-go build`, etc.

### dockle

<a href="https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle">dockle</a> - "Container Image Linter for Security, Helping build the Best-Practice Docker Image, Easy to start."

### OCI Registry Artifact Storage (ORAS)

<a href="https://oras.land/">ORAS</a> - "Push and pull OCI Artifacts to and from OCI Registries."

Since the invention of OCI registries, people have been (ab)using them to store non-container things (Helm charts, OPA policies, even video files can be stored this way). The modern registries are evolving as generic artifact stores, and the ORAS project provides a way to push and pull OCI Artifacts (read _arbitrary files_) to and from OCI Registries. The project consists of a CLI (<a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras">_oras_</a>) and libraries (<a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras-py">Python</a>).

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Docker Hub Tool

<a href="https://github.com/docker/hub-tool">Docker Hub Tool</a> - "Docker Hub experimental CLI tool."

A CLI tool for interacting with the Docker Hub. Get information about your images from the terminal. Docker's experiment to build a Docker Hub CLI tool. The intention of this project is to get user feedback and then to add this functionality to the Docker CLI itself.
