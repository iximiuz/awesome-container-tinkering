# Image Registries, Artifact Managment And Related Tools

Here you can find information about image registries and general artifact management

## Image registries projects

### Docker Registry

[Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/), the open source implementation for storing and distributing container images and other content, has been donated to the CNCF. Registry now goes under the name of Distribution, and the documentation has moved to [distribution project](https://github.com/distribution/distribution).

### ‚≠ê Registries Reference Project Distribution

<a href="https://github.com/distribution/distribution">distribution</a> - "The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute container images and other content. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license." The reference implementation of the holly <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec">OCI Distribution Specification</a>. Written in Go.

You can find a lot of helpful information at the [Distribution website](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/about/).

## Artifact Managmenent

### Harbor

[harbor](https://goharbor.io) stands as an open-source registry, safeguarding artifacts through policies and role-based access control. It ensures that images undergo scanning to eliminate vulnerabilities and are signed as trusted. As a CNCF Graduated project, Harbor guarantees compliance, performance, and interoperability, enabling you to consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud-native compute platforms such as Kubernetes and Docker.

### Artifact Hub

[Artifact Hub](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub) serves as a web-based platform facilitating the discovery, installation, and publication of packages and configurations for Cloud Native environments.

The challenge of discovering artifacts for CNCF projects can be daunting. The proliferation of individual artifact hubs for each project not only duplicates efforts but also fragments the user experience for artifact consumers. Artifact Hub addresses this by offering a unified platform accessible to all CNCF projects, streamlining the artifact discovery process and ensuring a cohesive experience for consumers.

You have the option to utilize the official CNCF Artifact Hub at <a href="https://artifacthub.io">artifacthub.io<a> or easily install it using the Artifact Hub Helm Chart, available at <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub">artifact-hub</a>.

### Nexus

[Nexus Repository](https://help.sonatype.com/en/docker-registry.html) supports Docker registries with the Docker repository and OCI Image format for hosted and proxy repositories. You can expose these repositories to the client-side tools directly or as a repository group, which is a repository that merges and exposes the contents of multiple repositories in one convenient URL. The Nexus general artifact management solution for multiple package systems like, Helm Charts, Java/Maven, Go, PyPi, NpM, NuGet, R, RubyGems, Yum or raw artifacts.

### Artifactory

[JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/de/artifactory/) is the comprehensive solution for storing and overseeing all your artifacts, binaries, packages, files, containers, and components, essential for your software supply chain.

## Cloud registry services

### Docker Hub

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is the world's first registry service to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications. Docker Hub is an online service that includes a registry for Docker images and repositories. The registry is divided into a public and a private part. In the public section, any user can upload their self-created images and make them available to others. Additionally, there are official images, such as those from Linux distributors. In the private section of Docker Hub, users can upload their Docker images, thus easily distributing them, for example, within a company, without them being publicly discoverable.

### GHCR

The [Github Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) stores container images within your organization or personal account, and allows you to associate an image with a repository. You can choose whether to inherit permissions from a repository, or set granular permissions independently of a repository. You can also access public container images anonymously. You can also store other package systems like RubyGems, npm, Maven/Gradle, NUGET artifacts.

The [Homebrew project](https://brew.sh) hosts macOS and Linux bottles](https://docs.brew.sh/Bottles) on its platform :)

### ACR

### GCR

The [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) is describe as an evolution of Container Registry, Artifact Registry serves as the central interface through which your company can manage container images and language packages (such as Maven and npm). The product is fully integrated into Google Cloud's tools and runtimes and supports native artifact protocols. This allows it to be easily integrated into your CI/CD tools for setting up automated pipelines.

### ECR

[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed container registry that provides high-performance hosting, allowing you to reliably deploy application images and artifacts anywhere.

### quay.io

The mission of [Quay](https://quay.io) is store your containers securely. Ensure your apps are stored privately, with access that you control. Quay is teamwork optimized, with powerful access controls. It use offen by Red Hat based project like podman or RKT.

<a href="https://oras.land/">ORAS</a> - "Push and pull OCI Artifacts to and from OCI Registries."

Since the invention of OCI registries, people have been (ab)using them to store non-container things (Helm charts, OPA policies, even video files can be stored this way). The modern registries are evolving as generic artifact stores, and the ORAS project provides a way to push and pull OCI Artifacts (read _arbitrary files_) to and from OCI Registries. The project consists of a CLI (<a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras">_oras_</a>) and libraries (<a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras-py">Python</a>).
